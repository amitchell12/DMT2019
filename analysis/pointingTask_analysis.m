% Takes pointing data from .csv files extracted from opensesame experiment
% Experiment: peripheral pointing task, touch targets presented at
% 24,31,37deg eccentricity
% Subtracts touch response to target from actual target location
% Does this for each target location (3 trials per target loc), for each
% eccentricity (9 trials per) and for each side (L/R - 27 trials per)

% Task will be used to compare pointing in AD patients with control
% patients
% For now- use for healthy pilot data
